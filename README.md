# Learning Python with ChatGPT

Attempting to learn basic Python with two resources: the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) examples and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) for explaining Python to me using concepts I already understand from JavaScript.

Not asking ChatGPT to _solve_ the riddles, just asking questions as I grok my way around a new language.

## Why?

I have no prior Python knowledge coming into this, just JS/TS, PHP, and some Ruby. ChatGPT came online just as Advent of Code was beginning, and when I saw [Paul Kinlan's post](https://paul.kinlan.me/ml-to-help-with-developer-experience/) about asking ChatGPT to build a webpage with a masonry layout, I wondered if I could have ChatGPT explain Python to me using concepts I already understand from JavaScript - skipping past "here's what a variable is" and jumping straight to "does `Array.reduce` exist in Python? Is that the best way to add an array of numbers together?" (this is when I learned about `sum()`)

I'm currently 3 lessons deep as I write this and it's by far the most fun I've had learning a new programming language. It truly feels like I'm pairing with another developer, it's wild.

Some screenshots of the questions I've asked are in the [screenshots](./screenshots) folder. Examples:

- I'm an experienced TypeScript developer who is learning Python. What are the main things I should know?
- What's a typical "hello, world" example in Python, compared to the same example in TypeScript?
- Does the map method from JavaScript exist in Python?
- Is `reduce` the best way to add an array of numbers together?
- Is there a package.json file or similar?
- What is the typical file structure for a basic Python project?
- Does Python have backticks for string concatenation like JS does?
- What does a typical gitignore for a Python project look like?
